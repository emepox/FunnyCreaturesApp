Funny Creatures is a pet project that I have been using in the past years to learn.

I made a Funny Creatures website to learn HTML and CSS. I made a Funny Creatures website to learn JavaScript.

Now I made a Funny Creatures app to refresh my Kotlin and Android skills.

The project is just a small eCommerce to buy monsters. I got the idea from the song Dr.Stein by Helloween.

The Funny Creatures Android App is made with love, but aside from that, I'm using:

- Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
- Jetpack Compose
- Flows & Coroutines
- DataStore
- Room
- Gson

This project will be my sandbox to practice and improve.

Thanks for reading.
